## Welcome to **Brokel Media**!

This is a blog for our group of friends to share our thoughts, experiences, and projects with each other. This blog serves as our collective digital garden where we come to share and talk about anything. From our daily experiences, things that we think about or just some random ass stuff to whatever you want.

## Base idea

The goal of all of this is simply to have a place away from all the algorithms, ads and whatever, where you can just talk to your friends and share your thoughts.

Maybe this is can be an alternative place in the internet to go to, read an article about something one of your friends has experienced, learned, is thinking about or whatever, and then you can get the fuck out of the internet again without all the dark forces pulling you back :D.

## What we write about

You can write about whatever you want!
You can find some ideas on what to write about [here](/posts/collection-of-ideas/).

## The technical side of things

Got an idea for a new feature? Found a bug? Something bothering you about the site? Let's it!

You can report issues, suggest features, or share complaints in two ways:
- **Edit the Post**: Check out the [Features, bugs or complaints](/posts/feedback-bugs-complaints/) and leave a comment.
- **GitHub Issues**: If you know how to, you can also open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brokel-media/brokel-media.github.io/issues) for technical matters

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). All of the stuff I added on top is heavily vibe coded.

If you're interested in contributing technically—whether it's improving the site, fixing bugs, or adding features—feel free to reach out!

You can also contribute directly on GitHub by creating pull requests or opening issues. If you'd like to be added to the organization for easier collaboration, just let me know!

We're always open to collaboration and suggestions.
