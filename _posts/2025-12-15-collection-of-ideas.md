## A Collection of Ideas

This post is meant to be a living document. A collection of ideas for things we could write about on this blog. **These are not rules or requirements**, just suggestions and inspiration for anyone looking for topics to explore. **Everyone is encouraged to add ideas for everyone** else in the comments or directly by editing this post.

### How This Works

Have an idea for a blog post topic? Simply edit this post by using the **contribute** tab on the left or just use the **comments**.

### Ideas

Looking forward to seeing what ideas everyone comes up with!

- Write about **something you have consumed** today. I consume Podcasts, Books, Youtube Videos constantly. On the toilet, in the train, while cooking, everywhere I am looking at or listening to something. I want to use this to take a step back and write a short paragraph about at least one thing I have consumed during my day, maybe only during my week. This way I can share what I have learned, started thinking about or laughed about and maybe start a conversation about it.
- Also feel free to share **your projects**. Whether it is Music, something you have built, rearranging your room, a hike or whatever.
- Sharing **your experience**. Quirin was on a steam boat in Dresden. Awesome. This looked super cool. I did not know these existed. This made me smile :)
